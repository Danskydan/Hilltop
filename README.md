# Hilltop

Hilltop is text-based, general-purpose programming language and model that borrows concepts from the spreadsheet programming model. 

A Hilltop application is described as a hierarchy of typed cells and cell attributes. Child cells begin with a ‘.’ and cell attributes begin with a ‘:’. Literal values are color-highlighted. 

An application is programmed by naming cells and providing formulas (i.e., code) for cell attrributes. As in a spreadsheet, cell attribute code is automatically reevaluated as the values of their dependencies change.
